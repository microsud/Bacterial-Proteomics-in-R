title: "Introduction to analysing microbial proteomics data in R"
---


This tutorial is focused towards analysing microbial proteomics data. Most of the analysis is done using the `DEP` R package created by [Arne Smits and Wolfgang Huber](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DEP/inst/doc/DEP.html]).

The data structure used by DEP is [SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html).
